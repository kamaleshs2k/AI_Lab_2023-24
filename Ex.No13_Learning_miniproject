# ABSTRACT

The NextGen-AQI Forecasting System is an intelligent machine learning application designed to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) with high accuracy. Using real-time and historical environmental data, it provides insights into pollution levels that can affect human health. The system employs an XGBoost regression model known for its speed and predictive precision. By integrating data visualization and analytics, it allows users to understand pollutant behavior. The goal is to support policymakers, environmentalists, and citizens in making data-driven decisions. The model achieves an impressive R² score of approximately 0.92, proving its reliability and accuracy.

# METHODOLOGY

The project follows a complete data science pipeline — from collection to deployment. It starts with data gathering of various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, and CO, alongside weather parameters such as temperature and humidity. The dataset undergoes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to enhance prediction capability. The refined data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. The XGBoost algorithm is trained to map pollutant levels to AQI values, optimizing parameters to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE). The model is then validated using R² and MAE metrics to ensure generalization and robustness.

# STEPS INVOLVED

1.Importing Libraries: Loading essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and xgboost for data manipulation and model training.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and removing outliers to prepare clean data.

3.Feature Selection: Choosing relevant air pollutant and meteorological parameters that impact AQI levels.

4.Model Training: Using XGBoost Regressor to train on pollutant features and predict AQI, with hyperparameter tuning.

5.Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE to ensure accuracy.

6.Deployment: Saving the trained model using pickle and deploying it via a Streamlit web app for real-time AQI predictions.

# Output and Results

The trained XGBoost model achieves a very high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.92), demonstrating its effectiveness in AQI prediction. The output includes both numerical predictions and visual graphs showing pollutant trends and forecasted AQI values. Users can manually input pollutant levels in the Streamlit interface to get instant AQI forecasts. Interactive plots help visualize correlations and pollution variations over time. The model not only predicts but also explains key contributors to poor air quality. Overall, the system provides a powerful, user-friendly, and scientifically reliable air quality forecasting solution.

The NextGen-AQI Forecasting Model was implemented on IBM LinuxONE, a high-performance enterprise Linux system.
LinuxONE provided exceptional processing power and scalability, enabling faster training of the XGBoost model.
Its secure and optimized cloud environment ensured smooth handling of large AQI datasets and computations.
The platform’s compatibility with Python and open-source libraries simplified machine learning deployment.
Overall, IBM LinuxONE enhanced model accuracy, execution speed, and system efficiency throughout the project.
